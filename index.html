            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Real estate isn't just about buildings and land; it's a vital part of our economy and personal lives.
                Whether you're a homeowner, investor, or policymaker, understanding property values is crucial. In this
                project, we focus on Greater Metropolitan Tokyo's real estate markets to uncover the key drivers that influence
                property prices.</p>
            <p>We are not just looking at traditional factors like location and size. Our analysis dives deeper,
                exploring a broad array of features and their intricate relationships with property values. By doing
                this, we aim to discover perspectives that go beyond conventional wisdom, reflecting trends such as Japan's
                prolonged period of low deflation over the past 15 years.</p>
            <p>Why does this matter? Because real estate decisions affect us all. A shift in property values can have
                significant economic impacts, as history has shown us. Our project isn't just for experts and
                developers; we're making it accessible to everyone. With interactive visualizations and clear
                explanations, we want to inform potential investors, real estate agents, homeowners, and even
                policymakers about what truly drives property values in Greater Metropolitan Tokyo. </p>
            <p>Ultimately, our goal is to forecast property values using detailed analysis, and in doing so, help
                various stakeholders make informed decisions. Whether you're managing a large portfolio of properties or
                just interested in understanding the market, this project offers a fresh, viewer-friendly perspective on
                real estate in one of the world's most fascinating regions.</p>
